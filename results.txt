fid for the teacher model - 24.193
Checkpoint: /teamspace/studios/this_studio/checkpoints_2/checkpoint_epoch_16.pt
FID: 67.7459
----------------------------------------
fid of the pretrained model is 15.6 
fid of the pretrained model with the paper weights is 5.55755 (ddim steps 100 and 50k images)
fid of the distilled student with 500 steps is 11.9650 (ddim steps 100 and 50k images)


***nuances***
1) the abrupt change in the fid of the student wrt the teacher is because we use loss parameterization in our distillation instead of v prediction and we dont use the right loss weighing scheme required
